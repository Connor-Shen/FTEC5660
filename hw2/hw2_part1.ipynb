Minor discrepancies such as specific employment dates, \"current\" status indicators, or slight location variations are tolerated if the overall narrative holds true. If there are general matches for school and experience on LinkedIn, score should be 0.5 or above.\n",

            "[{'type': 'text', 'text': 'DISCREPANCIES FOUND:\\n1.  **Employment Status Inconsistency (CV vs. LinkedIn):** The CV states \"Engineer, ByteDance, 2020 – Present\". The LinkedIn profile for John Smith (ID 9) shows the same role starting in 2020 with no end year, but the `is_current` flag is `False`. This contradicts the \"Present\" claim on the CV.\\n2.  **Major Employment Mismatch (CV/LinkedIn vs. Facebook):** The CV and LinkedIn profile claim \"Engineer, ByteDance\". However, Facebook profile ID 213 (Singapore) lists \"Scientist, Traveloka\" as the current job, and Facebook profile ID 8 (Kowloon) lists \"Engineer, Hang Seng Bank\". Neither Facebook profile\\'s employment details match the CV or LinkedIn.\\n3.  **Major Education Level Mismatch (CV/LinkedIn vs. Facebook ID 8):** The CV and LinkedIn profile state a \"Bachelor of Science (BSc) in Marketing\" from McGill University. Facebook profile ID 8 (Kowloon) lists a \"Doctoral Degree\".\\n4.  **Industry/Skill Mismatch (CV/LinkedIn vs. Facebook ID 213):** The CV and LinkedIn profile indicate a \"Marketing Professional\" with skills in Content Creation, SEO, and Social Media. Facebook profile ID 213 lists interests in \"Machine Learning\", which is inconsistent with a marketing background.\\n\\nVERIFICATION SUMMARY:\\nThe candidate\\'s CV shows strong consistency with the LinkedIn profile found, including name, professional headline, primary location, education details (school, degree, field, and graduation year), and listed skills. A minor inconsistency exists regarding the \"current\" status of the ByteDance role on LinkedIn. However, the Facebook profiles found present significant and irreconcilable contradictions with the CV and LinkedIn data concerning current employment, education level, and professional interests. It is highly probable that the identified Facebook profiles do not belong to the same individual as the CV and LinkedIn, or the candidate maintains vastly different and contradictory information across platforms. Given the strong alignment with LinkedIn but severe discrepancies with Facebook, the overall reliability is moderate.\\n\\nRELIABILITY_SCORE: 0.65', 'extras': {'signature':

            "[{'type': 'text', 'text': 'DISCREPANCIES FOUND:\\n1.  **Job Title/Seniority Mismatch (BCG):** The CV states \"Manager, BCG\" implying a standard manager role, while the LinkedIn profile lists the title as \"Manager\" but specifies \"junior\" seniority.\\n2.  **Skill Exaggeration (UI/UX Design, Graphic Design):** The CV lists \"UI/UX Design\" and \"Graphic Design\" as skills. The LinkedIn profile shows these skills with a proficiency level of 1 (beginner), suggesting potential exaggeration of skill level on the CV.\\n3.  **Facebook Current Employment Mismatch:** Both Facebook profiles found (ID 70 and ID 180) list \"Engineer\" as the current job and \"Manulife\" or \"Grab\" as the current company, which directly contradicts the CV\\'s claim of \"Manager, BCG\" and the LinkedIn profile\\'s matching information.\\n4.  **Facebook Education Mismatch:** Both Facebook profiles list \"Master\\'s Degree\" for education, whereas the CV and the LinkedIn profile consistently state \"BSc in Design\" from The University of Hong Kong.\\n5.  **Facebook Hometown Mismatch (ID 180):** One Facebook profile (ID 180) lists \"London\" as the hometown, which does not align with the CV\\'s implied locations of Beijing and Hong Kong.\\n\\nVERIFICATION SUMMARY:\\nThe candidate\\'s CV shows a strong alignment with the LinkedIn profile regarding professional experience (companies, job titles, and employment dates) and education (institution, degree, and field of study). However, there are minor discrepancies in the seniority of one role and the stated proficiency of certain skills on LinkedIn. The Facebook profiles present significant contradictions concerning current employment and education, suggesting either these profiles do not belong to the same individual, or the information on Facebook is outdated or inaccurate.

            "[{'type': 'text', 'text': 'DISCREPANCIES FOUND:\\n1.  **Employment Status at PwC:** The CV claims \"2013 – Present\" for the Engineer role at PwC. However, the LinkedIn profile for Wei Zhang (ID 97) indicates that this employment is *not* current (`is_current: False`).\\n2.  **Hometown:** The CV states \"Sydney (Hometown)\", but the Facebook profile for Wei Zhang (ID 97) lists \"Munich\" as the hometown.\\n3.  **Skill Exaggeration (Problem Solving):** The CV lists \"Problem Solving\" as a skill. While the LinkedIn profile also lists this skill, its proficiency level is indicated as 1 (beginner), which suggests a potential exaggeration on the CV if a higher level of expertise is implied.\\n4.  **Education Detail (Facebook):** The Facebook profile only mentions \"Bachelor\\'s Degree\" for education, which is less specific than the CV\\'s claim of \"BSc in Consulting, University of Tokyo, 2015\". While not a direct contradiction, it does not fully corroborate the specific details.\\n\\nVERIFICATION SUMMARY:\\nThe candidate\\'s name, current location (Munich, Germany), company (PwC), job title (Engineer), and start year (2013) for the professional experience are consistent across the CV, LinkedIn, and Facebook profiles. The education institution (University of Tokyo), degree (BSc in Consulting), and graduation year (2015) are consistent between the CV and LinkedIn. However, there are notable discrepancies regarding the current employment status at PwC, the claimed hometown, and the proficiency level of a listed skill. The Facebook education entry is too general to fully verify the CV\\'s specific education claim.\\n\\nRELIABILITY_SCORE: 0.65', 'extras': {'signature':

            "[{'type': 'text', 'text': 'DISCREPANCIES FOUND:\\n1.  **Employment Dates and Titles at Microsoft:** The CV claims \"Senior Engineer, Microsoft (2021 – 2027)\", including a future end date which is a logical impossibility for past employment. The most matching LinkedIn profile (ID 91) lists \"Engineer, Microsoft (2020 – 2025)\" with a \"junior\" seniority. This indicates significant discrepancies in job title, seniority, and employment dates.\\n2.  **Missing Employment:** The CV lists \"Consultant, StartupXYZ (2020 – 2023)\", which is completely absent from the most matching LinkedIn profile. This also creates an overlapping employment period with the Microsoft role.\\n3.  **Education Graduation Year:** The CV states PhD graduation in 2021, while the most matching LinkedIn profile shows a PhD graduation in 2019.\\n4.  **Skills Mismatch:** The CV lists \"Web3, Machine Learning, Quantum Computing\" which are not present in the skills section of the most matching LinkedIn profile. Proficiencies for shared skills (Compliance, Litigation, Contract Review) also differ.\\n5.  **Location Inconsistency:** The CV lists \"Singapore (Hometown) | Singapore / Philippines\". The most matching LinkedIn profile lists \"Cebu, Philippines\". While \"Philippines\" is a partial match, the \"Singapore\" hometown claim is not consistently supported across social media profiles.\\n\\nVERIFICATION SUMMARY:\\nThe CV for Rahul Sharma presents significant inconsistencies when cross-referenced with available LinkedIn and Facebook profiles. While a LinkedIn profile (ID 91) shows a strong match for the PhD education (degree, field, and university), there are major discrepancies in employment history, including a missing job, conflicting dates, a future employment end date, and differing job titles/seniority for the Microsoft role.

            "[{'type': 'text', 'text': 'DISCREPANCIES FOUND:\\n1.  **Education Mismatch:** The CV claims a \"PhD in Artificial Intelligence from University of Tokyo, 2012\". The most plausible LinkedIn profile (ID 95) lists an \"MSc in AI from University of Tokyo, 2012\". One Facebook profile (ID 12) mentions a \"Doctoral Degree\" but does not specify the institution, while another (ID 7) lists a \"Master\\'s Degree\".\\n2.  **Current Employment Mismatch (EY):** The CV states \"Senior Engineer at EY, Current\". LinkedIn profile ID 95 lists \"Engineer at EY\" with a start year of 2005, which is significantly earlier than expected for a post-PhD role and implies a much longer tenure than the CV suggests for a \"current\" role. Both Facebook profiles (ID 7 and ID 12) list completely different current employers and job titles (\"Analyst at NextGen AI\" and \"Manager at PwC\" respectively).\\n3.  **Experience Mismatch (DataForge):** The CV claims \"Senior Analyst at DataForge, 2016 – Present\". LinkedIn profile ID 95 lists \"Analyst at DataForge, 2017 - Current\", showing a discrepancy in seniority and start year.\\n4.  **Experience Mismatch (UrbanFlow):** The CV claims \"Lead Scientist at UrbanFlow, 2010 – 2017\". LinkedIn profile ID 95 lists \"Scientist at UrbanFlow, 2012 - 2016\", showing discrepancies in seniority and dates.\\n5.  **Missing Experience (StartupXYZ):** The role \"Consultant at StartupXYZ, 2019 – 2021\" is not present on any of the retrieved LinkedIn or Facebook profiles.\\n6.  **Implausible Overlapping Roles (LinkedIn):** LinkedIn profile ID 95 shows overlapping full-time employment periods: \"Engineer at EY (2005-Current)\", \"Scientist at UrbanFlow (2012-2016)\", and \"Analyst at DataForge (2017-Current)\". This suggests multiple concurrent full-time positions, which is highly improbable.\\n7.  **Overlapping Roles (CV):** The CV itself lists \"DataForge, 2016 – Present\" and \"UrbanFlow, 2010 – 2017\", which are overlapping full-time roles.\\n8.  **Seniority Inflation:** The CV consistently claims \"Senior\" or \"Lead\" roles, while the most plausible LinkedIn profile (ID 95) lists lower seniorities (\"Engineer\", \"Analyst\", \"Scientist\") for the same companies.\\n9.  **Skills Proficiency:** While skills are listed, the proficiency levels on LinkedIn for some key skills (e.g., NLP proficiency 1, Python proficiency 2) are low, contradicting the \"AI Professional\" claim.\\n\\nVERIFICATION SUMMARY:\\nThe CV presents numerous and significant discrepancies when cross-referenced with both LinkedIn and Facebook profiles. There are major inconsistencies in education details, professional experience (companies, titles, dates, and seniorities), and implausible overlapping employment periods.
